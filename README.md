# Customer-churn-banking

Motivation and Problem
Why this problem is important
The problem we have addressed within our project is that of customer churning which negatively affects
businesses across many sectors. Customer churn rate is defined as the rate at which customers stop
doing business with an entity, and in our case, a bank. Customer retention is incredibly important for
three main reasons. The first point is fairly obvious, banks lose money when they do not have
customers. This cannot be understated as banks lose over a quarter of their customers per year, which
has many significant negative impacts. Second, obtaining new customers by banks costs roughly five to
seven times more than it costs to retain current customers, placing a higher financial prioritization on
retention over new customer outreach. Third, bank churn rates often become public and threaten the
reputation of these organizations. To avoid bankruptcy, it is imperative that banks have a strong
customer retention strategy which would benefit greatly from the ability to predict whether or not
specific customers are likely to close their accounts.


solution:
Our model offers an early warning system for customer churn by flagging at-risk customers using key features like age and activity, enabling the bank to enhance customer retention strategies seamlessly within their existing digital architecture. The system's simplicity, low cost, and insightful feature analysis make it a valuable tool for improving customer engagement and trust.
